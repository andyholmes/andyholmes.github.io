Just an update on where you can find me.

## Opensource and Social Media

I've done the tour through reddit, Twitter and Mastodon, and now I'm all done.
These platforms have proven to be systemically flawed at encouraging healthy
socialization, and really just seem to bring out the worst in people.

I have no desire to bring out the worst in myself, so I won't be available on
any platform outside of development channels.

## Contact

Instead, you can find me on GNOME's [Discourse][discourse], [GitLab][gitlab]
and [Matrix][matrix] instances, as well as [GitHub][github]. Anything that
doesn't end up in an upstream project, will be here instead.
