This year, I was invited by Sonny Piers to be a co-mentor for the GNOME
Foundation, working on platform demos for Workbench. I already contribute a lot
of entry-level documentation and help a lot of contributors, so this felt like
a good step in a direction I've been heading for a while.

## Internships

Together, Sonny and I mentored three interns; two by way of Google Summer of
Code (GSoC) and a third for Outreachy. Both are international programs providing
a great opportunity for newcomers, but differ in some important ways.

### Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code] has been around for a very long time, although I've been
around long enough to remember when it started, and how it helped change the
public image of open source. Google's program is well developed, while at the
same time being mostly hands-off, leaving most of the planning and direction
to the mentors.

Something that did influence our choice of applicants was the requirement that
interns be open source beginners, which I feel doesn't account for those who
could benefit from more advanced mentoring. Of course, we had plenty of
applicants and I have no regrets about our selection.

### Outreachy

[Outreachy] is a newer program and one that actually started as an initiative
of the GNOME Foundation. It is focused on those that are underrepresented in the
industry, and fostering a positive feedback loop to address this ongoing issue.

In contrast to Google's program, Outreachy is not limited to students or
developers, which is important when you consider the barriers to education and
lack of opportunity its applicants often face. The program also includes prompts
and goals, both for mentors and mentees, that help make these internships more
engaging.

The infrastructure for Outreachy is kind of unassuming at first, compared to
Google's sleek and streamlined website. Once you're a few weeks into the
program though, you realize they really are a lot more focused on genuine
mentorship. Nothing about your interaction with the coordinators is impersonal
or superficial.

[Marina Zhurakhinskaya] deserves special mention here, and even if you haven't
heard the name before, you have heard the names of those whose lives she
touched. Although I never had the honour of working with her myself, it's
impossible to ignore how we all continue to benefit from her contributions.

## People

I should first thank [Sonny] for the opportunity to participate as a mentor for
the GNOME Foundation. This is not something I've been able to do in a formal way
since high school when I was allowed extra classes to assist younger students
in the electronics program.

We've all been in the position where you really just need someone to answer the
question, *"Okay, but how does it actually work?"*. Being a part of the
*"Oh, now I get it!"* moments is an unparalleled experience for me. I'm really
grateful I had the chance to be involved in this way again.

### Akshay Warrier

[Akshay] is going to do great things in open source and I think he really gets
community-driven software. He's one of those people that renews your excitement
for open source.

Aside from the contributions he's made to Workbench as part of his internship,
I was really excited to see him appear at our yearly GNOME Shell Extensions
workshop. I know he had a fantastic time at GUADEC and the way he talked
about it made it obvious how much importance he places on people.

I think we'll see more of Akshay and, one day, I think he could make a really
great mentor himself.

### José Hunter

[José] comes up with some great ideas, and he's quick to jump in and get them
implemented. Given the right circumstances, I think we might see him do some
really cool things in the community.

He's blogged about privacy and the encroach of corporate interests, and it's
hard not to think this encouraged his involvement in open source. I think he
has a natural impulse to form his own opinions about the technology he uses and
employs, and an honest interest in projects related to his hobbies like
`libmanette`.

I hope José sticks around after his internship is complete, because he has
a personality that has served the community well in the past.

### Sriyansh Shivam

[Sriyansh] displayed an aptitude for development early on, but also a habit of
responding to feedback in a really constructive and professional way. That's a
hard thing to do sometimes, and he really has the drive for self-improvement.

We spent a fair amount of time working through a series of demos about the
model-view-controller pattern together, and I really enjoyed that. These demos
covered everything from `GListModel` and `GtkListBox`, to the newer view widgets
like `GtkColumnView`. These are very popular in GTK4 applications, and often
quite complex, so I'm quite proud to see the results of his hard work.

I'm not sure we really had a chance to see his full potential, and I hope he
gets the opportunity to take on a longer more challenging project.

## The Future

I hope to have the time and opportunity to mentor again, and next time I would
like to apply myself in a more thoughtful way. I write a lot of entry-level
documentation for free software, but the feedback is far more asynchronous and
has to be applied more statistically.

Having spent time with several mentees over an extended period of time was a
good way to learn a lot. Sonny and I had some good conversations about what
seemed to work in retrospect, which was very enlightening. I would really like
to try mentoring again, but next time with a more developed strategy.

I will say that co-mentoring is definitely something we should encourage more
as a community. It's difficult to be confident of your take on an interpersonal
relationship, and having someone to balance that turned out to be invaluable to
the mentorship.
