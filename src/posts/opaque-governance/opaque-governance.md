Recently, Tobias Bernard posted a retrospective of his (and our) experience
engaging with the GNOME Foundation regarding the removal of Sonny Piers from
our community, followed by a response from Allan Day. I know it's difficult and
stressful to talk about; a lot of people just want it to go away. It took a
long time to write this.

The details regarding the removal of Sonny Piers will never be publicized, but
I respectfully disagree that all discussion of the community impact should
happen internally. Regardless of the circumstances at the time, the GNOME
Foundation made a decision to publicly remove Sonny Piers from the community
and if we are asked to assume good faith, we should be able expect the same
good faith when we criticize governance.

## Safety in the Community

The case of Sonny Piers includes GNOME Foundation membership, a seat on the
board of directors and employment as a project coordinator. Circumstances these
complex do not relate to the Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) in its typical
operation.

The Engagement Team also plays an active role in day-to-day moderation, as well
as the community members from diverse backgrounds serving as moderators in the
many project channels. Recently a member of the CoCC helped organize a
communication channel and new guidelines for moderators, which has already
improved coordination and response times across the various platforms.

The GNOME community is a safe place to engage in open source and the matters
discussed here should not prevent you from reporting an incident or flagging
content for moderation.

## Opaque Context

The following is a very incomplete timeline, providing some amount context for
my personal perspective.

In July 2024, many of us in the community were shocked to hear that Sonny Piers
had been removed as a GNOME Foundation director, stripped of his membership,
had all accounts locked and a permanent ban put in place. More unsettling,
he was named as the recipient of a Code of Conduct complaint, but obviously
without any details regarding the incident.

With such limited information, for many there was little justification to
protest the decision itself, except that the degree of disciplinary action
implied behaviour extremely out of character for Sonny.

By October, three months had passed and lacking any meaningful resolution,
enough concern had grown in parts of the community to have a conversation. It
was decided to compose a letter directly to the Board and, after lengthy
discussion of the content, those that agreed signed and it was received
generally well by the Board.

The resulting meetings were draining for everyone involved, often with visible
exertion of good faith from those present. The many constructive results
include several amendments to CoCC procedures, more comprehensive and equitable
agreements for contractors, and a fair amount of clarification regarding the
constraints the Board was under at the time.

By December, I had withdrawn from most social spaces in the community. During
the period of engagement with the Board, there were a conspicuous number of
public references made to [toxic influencers] and after a very disappointing
comment from a relevant party, I closed my Mastodon account. Aside from
compounding the stress of the meetings, I considered I might be compelled to
publicly defend Sonny and compromise our efforts with the Board.

In January, Tobias published *[Re-Decentralizing Development]* and seeing the
reactions include sentiments like *"Cult of Sonny"* more or less vindicated my
decision to withdraw from social spaces. Some clearly assumed there had been
no effort to resolve the matter internally and the spectre of a toxic influencer
meant attempts to engage publicly were unlikely to be taken in good faith.

## Good Faith

There are legitimate concerns about an effort to undermine the Code of Conduct
(CoC), for the sake of meritocracy. In other words, there are those concerned
about different rules being applied to those who contribute more substantially
or have more social capital. This is not paranoia; it's the state of justice
in many of our real-world societies.

The opposing concern is that the CoC has been used as a tool to defend the
status quo or enforce minority opinion as policy. Or as Tobias puts it:

> [...] we’re now in a situation where large parts of the community do not
> trust our CoC structure because they feel it can be weaponized as part of
> internal power struggles.

Code of Conduct reports must be confidential and the decisions of the committee
must be unimpeachable; under no circumstance can they become a matter of public
opinion.

Unsurprisingly, there are very few situations that justify revealing any
participant of a Code of Conduct report. Doing so has resulted in reputational
damage such that an uncensored Google search of the name *"Sonny Piers"* returns
pages of tabloid smear and speculation of criminality. Yet in the many months
since, there has been no indication that this served the interests of community
safety.

Although I acknowledge the community ban has since been relaxed to one year,
I would like if we could each appreciate that to be stripped of membership,
barred from ever holding a position in the Foundation and permanently banned
from all community spaces is to be told, *"You are irredeemable"*. Again, in
the time of Sonny's absence, there have been no signs that the safety of the
community ever warranted a permanent ban.

The good faith assumption seems to be that these actions were taken to send a
message: the Code of Conduct will be enforced, regardless of a person's stature
in the community. Unfortunately, if that was the intention, a number in the
community have already expressed confusion that this situation received
treatment so different from their own.

## Trust and Accountability

I spent a fair amount of time recently deciding whether I would renew my
Foundation membership or not. Those in the Foundation working to rectify the
breakdown of communication and policy are the reason I decided to stay. However,
there are also those in the Foundation who have made me feel an unwelcome
bystander to the very public condemnation of a colleague, only be told not to
cause a fuss.

I strongly believe the CoCC operated on an unfounded assumption of bad faith:
that Sonny Piers is a toxic influence to be immediately and permanently removed
from the community. Since July, none of the corroborating signs have surfaced;
few have had more contact with Sonny than a short email response, there has
been no public appeal to gather signatures, no *coup d'état* in the Foundation
and, with two months left on the community ban, fears of him being exempt from
the rules seem moot.

A number of the recent policy improvements were prompted by the findings of the
external review commissioned by the Foundation, but I'd like to clarify this
was an assessment of whether the Code of Conduct Committee acted within its
scope and authority; not a judicial review. The severity of corrective action
has not been justified, nor did any review findings or policy changes apply
retroactively.

While the Foundation has and will continue to improve, it seems unlikely we
will see accountability for the mishandling of a situation that has caused
damage to an individual, to the community and trusting relationships. For
trust to be restored, we must be assured that Code of Conduct Committee is
free from conflicts of interest and is only applied in the interests of
community safety.

## Final Thoughts

I don't know what to do about this. I know there are those in the Foundation
working very hard to improve the situation and those on the Board aware that
they can just ignore criticism until their seat is up for re-election.

The GNOME Foundation is becoming a more important part of the GNOME project
every year, but it is still extremely opaque to most of us. If there is a way
to educate oneself as a voter I do not know it, and we must accept that has
become a serious problem.

We can not have confidence in leaders elected on vague familiarity and then
expect accountability from elections separated by two years. And the GNOME
Foundation can not build trust in governance by appealing to its own authority.
